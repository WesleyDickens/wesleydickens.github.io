The first thing you probably noticed about this website is that it's ugly. This both is and isn't on purpose.
</p>
<p>
Now that my company is implementing a four day work week, I wanted to take this as an opportunity to grow both personally and professionally.
I plan to accomplish this by learning for the sake of learning, and the best way for me to do that is by explaining things. 
</p>
<p>
    The true mark of understand something is your ability to explain it to someone else who has no prior knowledge. So when I find something I don't understand, my goal is to research and learn as much as I can 
    and then write a post explaining it. 
</p>
<p><u>Now, why is my website ugly?</u></p>
<p>
    I started out building something on Squarespace and it was really easy. Too easy. I came to the conclusion that if this whole Friday project is about
    growing and learning, I should take this opportunity to learn something new -- How to build a website. 
</p>
<p>
    I haven't touched HTML or CSS since learning how to change the cursor on my Myspace page; And I haven't used Javascript since I 
    built a phishing website to steal Runescape accounts in middle school. (for legal reasons that's a joke)
</p>
<p>
    All that to say, I have a lot of learning to do before this website looks nice, and I couldn't be more excited about that. 
</p>

<p><u>So, what is this website/blog meant to be?</u></p>
<p>This blog is going to be a brain dump of things I'm curious about -- There is no theme beyond that. </p>
<p><u>So, what is this website/blog <b>not</b> meant to be?</u></p>
<p>I have no plans to monetize this, or advertise it in any way. If you're reading this, then odds are I sent it to you personally.</p>
<p>I also don't want this to serve as a personal diary, I have my own private journal for that. So I won't be writing about anything personal or opinionated.</p>
<p>That's it, thanks for stopping by!</p>
